# Speech Emotion Recognition

This repository contains our work on Speech emotion recognition using emodb dataset. This dataset is available here [Emo-db](http://www.emodb.bilderbar.info/download/)

### Prerequisites
Linux (preferable Ubuntu LTS). Python2.x 

### Installing dependencies
*Note*: You can skip this step, if you are installing the packages. 
Dependencies are listed below and in the `requirements.txt` file.

* h5py
* Keras
* scipy
* sklearn
* speechpy
* tensorflow

Install one of python package managers in your distro. If you install pip, then you can install the dependencies by running 
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

If you prefer to accelerate keras training on GPU's you can install `tensorflow-gpu` by 
`pip3 install tensorflow-gpu`

### Directory Structure
- `speechemotionrecognition/` - Package folder which contains all the code files corresponding to package
- `dataset/` - Contains the speech files in wav formatted seperated into 7 folders which are the corresponding labels of those files
- `models/` - Contains the saved models which obtained best accuracy on test data.
- `examples/` - Contains examples on how to use the package

### Details of the package
- `utilities.py` - Contains code to read the files, extract the features and create test and train data
- `mlmodel.py` - Code to train non DL models. We have three models
	- `1 - SVM`
	- `2 - Random Forest`
	- `3 - Neural Network`
- `dnn.py` - Code to train Deep learning Models. Supports two models given below
    - `1 - CNN`
    - `2 - LSTM`

### Examples
Have a look at `examples/` directory. `ml_example.py` has examples using ML models.
`cnn_example.py`  and `lstm_example.py` has examples using cnn and lstm models. 

### Documentation
Code documentation can be found [here](https://harry-7.github.io/speech-emotion-recognition/html/main.html)

### Installation

A `setup.py` file is provided in the repository. You can run `sudo python3 setup.py install` to install it at system level.
If you don't have privileges to do so, you can install it at user level by running `python3 setup.py install --user`.
